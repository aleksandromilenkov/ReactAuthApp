# React JS Application
I created React App for learning React Authentication.  
I'm using Firebase authentication and I'm storing the data in firebase database  
I'm also using React Router  
I implemented:  
- User Sign Up  
- User Login  
- User Logout
- User can change his password  
- Handling error 404 page  
- Redirecting to home page  
- Protecting routes and protecting frontend pages   
- Storing the token in Local Storage  
- I'm using useContext  
- Adding auto-logout
